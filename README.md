4. The Collatz python program  asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, 
but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
Have the program end if the current value is one. <br />

6. The Function python progam takes the input from the user which is a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. The method that is to be used is the newton method. Newton's method works by taking an estimate of the root of the equation and calculating a more accurate estimate, a process that can be repeated to approximate the true value of the root more precisely. Main reference for my work for this task was th website www.geeksforgeeks.org and also www.w3schools.com
