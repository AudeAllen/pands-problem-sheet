# This program just reads in two money amounts and adds them together 
# The answer must be in readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount

#Set up two input variables to read in amounts - amount1 and amount2
#Some error handling done to check that the user has input a positive number
#Mesesage appears to user if input is a string or is a negative number
